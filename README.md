Description

It is created mainly for setting and controlling the expenditures and savings of the users. In this case, quite a rudimentary console centered application is provided for the process of adding, showing, and changing products.

Usage

The code has to be compiled using C compiler (e.g. gcc product_manager.c -o product_manager)

Once the application is installed, please execute the command (e.g. ./product_manager)

Follow the menu ideas and add, show, or modify the products
